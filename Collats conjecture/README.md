Strange algorithm.

Consider an algorithm that takes a positive integer as input number <code>n</code>. If n is even, then the algorithm divides it by two, and if it is odd, then cuts by three and adds 1.
For example, for n = 3 we get the following subsequence:
3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

Remarks:
1. cmake is used: create a build folder (the name doesn't matter), go to this folder and run <code>cmake ..</code> from this folder;
2. unimplemented number checks.
